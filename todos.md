join groups pages shows a section of groups which i am already a member of

similarly, create group page shows groups that i have created

OR, in the same lists of groups, i can just add a tag saying ('member' or 'creator')

each user's name in the group chat should have a unique color :)



1. process.env. not working => process not defined
2. fix joinGroup debounced search
3. createdAt + createdBy added => update tests + uncomment empty checker for this in messagecontroller
